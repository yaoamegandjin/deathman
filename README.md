## Overview
This is a Hangman game built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
Players can sign up and log in to track their scores. The game also features a global leaderboard where players can see how they rank against others. The frontend is built with React, while the backend uses Express and Node.js to handle game logic and data storage in MongoDB. This project was a fun experience, combining classic gameplay with modern web development skills.
